### Day 1: Wednesday February 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on a minutes to hours converter, and I was able to figure out the JavaScript code to make the conversion happen when click the Convert button.

**Thoughts** I've been coding regularly since December 2016, but this was my first independent project. The moment that the converter actually worked was a magical moment indeed!
