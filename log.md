**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Wednesday February 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on a minutes to hours converter, and I was able to figure out the JavaScript code to make the conversion happen when click the Convert button.

**Thoughts** I've been coding regularly since December 2016, but this was my first independent project. The moment that the converter actually worked was a magical moment indeed!
