# 100 Days Of Code - The Mighty Log

### Day 21: Tuesday February 21, 2017 - in progress

**Today's Progress**: 
- Finished Udemy's Web Development Bootcamp Section 9: Javascript Basics: Control Flow. Up next: Section: 10 Javascript Basics: Functions
- Figured out what was wrong with my Portfolio thumnail images (had to change the width and height in the links)


**Thoughts:** 

Correctly wrote JavaScript code for the following:

Print all numbers between -10 and 19

Print all even numbers between 10 and 40

Print all odd numbers between 300 and 333

Print all numbers divisible by 5 AND 3 between 5 and 50

### Day 20: Monday February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued Udemy's Web Development Bootcamp lessons (working through JavaScript sections)
- Cleaned up codes with Sublime's Reindent feature 
- Reorganized programming folders/files

**Thoughts:** 
Today was another good day of learning and practicing. I'm working through the JavaScript section of my current course. I've learned a few new things, and have remembered things I've forgotten from weeks ago. I'm currently on the section about loops and working my way to the section about Objects (Objects is where I got stuck on Free Code Camp).

### Day 19: Sunday February 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked in the DOM and with JavaScript at today's Free Code Camp meetup

**Thoughts:** 
I really enjoyed today's meetup (as I do each week). Today, we spent a lot of time discussing the DOM and practicing some JavaScript. One of the things I love most about being around others when learning are the little things that you pick up. Things are mentioned in passing that feel life changing lol. 

For example, I didn't know that text editors can rearrange your code to make it look better. In Sublime, highlight your code and go to Edit > Line > Reindent and voila, your code is cleaned up! I don't know the ins and outs of this or how reliable it is yet, but I will be utilizing this going forward.

### Day 18: Saturday February 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
- continued working on new portfolio page

**Thoughts:** 
- Not much done today as I was entertaining my nieces throughout the day, but I made some good progress on my portfolio. It's coming along nicely.

### Day 17: Friday February 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
- Finished HTML and CSS sections of Udemy's Web Development Bootcamp. 
- Adjusted columns on portfolio for different screen sizes (changed each to col-lg-3 col-med-3 col-sm-6). Also, started a new one from scratch since I'm still experiencing some issues.
- Created new landing page for one of my websites

**Thoughts:** 
Udemy - I am thoroughly enjoying Udemy's Web Development Bootcamp course. Video lessons have been a great addition to my learning process. It's very helpful being able to see what someone is doing as well as hear explanations opposed to strictly reading. I am now to the JavaScript section, and I look forward to learning. Again, I bought this course specifically for help with JavaScript so I'm excited for another opportunity to learn this content. 

Portfolio - The navbar was working properly, but the jumbotron engulfed the entire page. After being unsuccessful in figuring out where the issue was, I went through line-by-line (again) comparing to a solution from Web Development Bootcap (which led to another issue of the navbar icons not showing up, but I found an updated font awesome link on StackOverflow that worked).

Landing Page - When I first was introduced to Bootstrap, I didn't know what to think. It seemed to good to be true and almost like cheating. On Codepen, you simply click the Quickadd buttong, and you can then do all of these magical things. What has helped me understand Bootstrap a lot more was actually seeing the css file. I had no idea what the magic was before. Now, I can actually look through the css to see how everything works. It doesn't feel like cheating anymore because it's exremely intricate, you still need a deep understanding, and I can go in and edit things if needed. 

Using Bootstrap, I started working on a new landing page for one of my sites, gamesandkeys.com (video game piano tutorials, sheet music, and midi files). My focus is not currently on music and I haven't made any video game piano tutorials for awhile, but the site is still active and still gets traffic. I think I may keep going with this new version and do a complete overhaul. 

**Sidenote Jones:** NBA Allstar Weekend!

### Day 16: Thursday February 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FINALLY fixed navbar on portfolio to stay fixed at top (container needed to be ABOVE the navbar) 
. Also, fixed hamburger menu (needed to manually add bootstrap links from site opposed to using the quick links in codepen). Udemy course led me to finding this error.

Update 1: Never mind. Moving the container broke some other parts of the page (put whole page in a jumbotron and messed up the footer). Back to the drawing board!

Update 2: I found the error!!! I missing </nav>!!! I feel so relieved and frustrated at the same time lol. Great way to wrap up the night though :) 

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking I may need to start from scratch with my portfolio. But I do feel like I can eventually figure out why the navbar will not work when fixed (and let's be honest, I don't want to start over from scratch lol).

It's been fun experimenting and getting different things to work, but unfortunately breaking things is a part of the process. I will figure this out. I will figure out how to have a fixed navbar and footer with everything in between displaying properly.

### Day 15: Wednesday February 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Udemy lessons then created CSS Tic Tac Toe board and blog from scratch.  

**Thoughts:** I couldn't be happier with my progress as well as my continued passion for learning how to code. I've hit a lot of different roadblocks along the way, but today showed me how much I've learned over the last couple of months. 

Since I had gotten stuck on multiple JavaScript challenges in Free Code Camp, I decided to find another resource to help me learn (enter Udemy's Web Development Bootcamp). Although I got the course for JavaScript, I thought it'd be a good idea to not jump ahead. I just completed the CSS section, and I felt extremeley comfortable on all of the little projects. All of the reps and different classes definitely helped me grasp these concepts. 

Now, I'm hoping that this course can help these JavaScript concepts sink in more. I've been around JavaScript in SoloLearn, Free Code Camp, and various tutorials online, but it still feels over my head. It will be a marathon, and I'm prepared to getScript('or Die Tryin'). Let's do this!

### Day 14: Tuesday February 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Used JavaScript and the DOM tutotials to create webpages with various functionality. Completed CSS Selectors exercise in Udemy's Web Development Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:**  Going off of DevTips' tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM9h1wN4rfU), I created a webpage that changes colors as you move the mouse around the page as well as a page that changes colors as the time changes. This was all pure JavaScript and still very confusing as the moment. This was recommended to prep for Sunday's Free Code Camp meetup, so I at least have been introduced to these concepts. 
After a few days away from Udemy, I got back to those lessons and completed the CSS Selctors exercise. I feel like I have a pretty good early understanding of CSS, and I continue to be impressed with each new thing that I learn it can do.

### Day 13: Monday February 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Found error in my JavaScript quiz. ONE missing parenthesis messed up the whole code! Also, finally finished HTML section of Gen 1 Pokemon Chart.

**Thoughts:** Why did I choose something with 151 different character for an early table project? This took forever!! But I was determined to finish. I'm sure there was an easier way to input this information especially with some coding, and I look forward to implementing some changes in the future. I'd want to change the view from numerical to alphabetical without creating a second page and re-entering all of the data again. I'll be on the lookout for how to do this.

### Day 12: Sunday February 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Created a JavaScript quiz during today's Free Code Camp meetup. Also, continued filling out Pokedex. 

**Thoughts:** As we created the JavaScript quiz, I felt like a pro setting up the basic HTML and CSS sections. Then, JavaScript stepped in and kicked my butt! I understood the concepts, but I have a long way to go before I can create this kind of content on my own. The good thing is that it gets me more pumped and hungrier to keep pushing forward. Baby steps.

### Day 11: Saturday February 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Continued filling in Pokedex. Good amount of reps creating hrefs by scratch. 

**Thoughts:** Feeling better than yesterday. I should be back in my regular zone tomorrow.

### Day 10: Friday February 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: More work on the Pokedex. Hyperlinked the Number and Name titles to allow user to rearrange the Pokemon by number of name. Filled in more Pokemon info. Removed background photo. Also, created a repository https://github.com/MightyJoeW/Pokedex.

**Thoughts:** Still under the weather so today was mostly filling in information opposed to creating new things.

### Day 9: Thursday February 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: More Web Development Bootcamp CSS lessons plus additional work on Pokedex. Created pages for numerical list and alphabetical list.

**Thoughts:** Very tough day with flu-like symptoms, but made it an hour.

### Day 8: Wednesday February 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Week 1 complete! More HTML and CSS review (working through Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele). Practiced CSS with an 'About Me' page and a 'To Do list' page.

**Thoughts:** Today has been another very productive day so far. Colt Steele's lessons are very good, and I definitely enjoy having video content to learn from now. It seems like concepts are sticking better by being able to hear, watch, and participate opposed to solely reading and practicing. This was another good review for me as I lead up to the JavaScript section (why I really bought this course).

**Sidenote Jones:** Whenever I get the hiccups, they last for days (sometimes weeks). I've had the hiccups since yesterday, and it's the most irritating thing when trying to learn and practice anything. And yes, I've tried all of the methods. None of the ever work, but I'll take suggestions... Hmm, since this problem has not been solved for me, I guess I need to create a solution and app to take care of this. To the laboratory!

### Day 7: Tuesday February 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed HTML and CSS. Created a few basic HTML pages including a Pokemon chart and a login page.

**Thoughts:** I decided to try out Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. It's currently $15 (regular price $200), and I had seen many different people comment about how great this content is. I've been getting stuck on FCC challenges and felt like a needed a solid training program to go along with it. So far, it's been great!

A couple of simple things I've picked up already are many helpful shortcuts in Sublime Text as well as how to hyperlink to a local file (relative path). I only knew how to hyperlink other webpages. The rest has been a good review of some HTML and CSS things I've forgotten.

**Sidenote Jones:** I never imagined growing up that I'd be seeing Pokemon in learning material (or dominating mainstream news and media like when Pokemon Go took off). I still have my original Pokemon Yellow and Silver (I gave my Red and Blue away along with my wrestling action figures in a garage sale when we moved back in the day).

### Day 6: Monday February 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Morning - Free Code Camp lessons. Evening - Got my first HTTP server up and running with node.js.

**Thoughts:** Node.js seems to be functioning properly. However, Express is still giving me issues. I don't think everything installed correctly (I saw some errors). Also, when trying to open package.json, I get the following: 

 {
 "name": "myapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

Being new to all of this, it's too early for me to even know what to look for in regards to what's going wrong. I'm going to keep pushing the next few days because I want to get this all set up and be able to shift more of my attention back to coding. Not a fun day of coding, but an important one.

### Day 5: Sunday February 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Spent more time learning how to use GitHub. Then, worked with Node.js and React for the first time at Free Code Camp. 

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how quickly you can go from feeling on top of the world to feeling like you know absolutely nothing. This happens often to me at our Free Code Camp meetups lol. I have a decent understanding of HTML and CSS, and I'm getting more comfortable with JavaScript, but I have never seen Node.js or React before. I felt like my brain was put in a blender, but I was happy to get exposed to both of these early in my learning. I've wanted to learn both, and I got a little preview of what they both are like.

### Day 4: Saturday February 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Learned my way around GitHub.

**Thoughts:** At this past Free Code Camp meetup, we spent a lot of time in GitHub. I felt like it was moving too fast, so I really wanted to get a grasp on how to use GitHub. It looked like I was looking at gibberish before, but now it makes a lot more sense.

### Day 3: Friday February 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Minutes to Hour Converer! Well, at least for now...
- added lang=""en-us"" to HTML
- added <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""> // trying to make mobile friendly
- removed parenthesis from around <h3> It looked bad on mobile.
- added mobile friendly code from w3 schools in .body. Can't figure out how to move everything to the center now. Found it!!! Change margin to auto!!
- fixed footer on mobile by changing position from absolute to fixed :D

**Thoughts:** It felt really good completing my first little project (especially without using jQuery or Bootstrap). I intentially decided not to use those as I'm still early in learning JavaScript and want to have a better understanding of it first. Plus, it sounds like they are losing popularity anyway.

### Day 2: Thursday February 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Got the web version of my minutes to hours converter looking decent. However, the mobile view was UGLY! Specific steps:
- Added footer with copyright 
- changed background (removed clock img since it looked bad on narrow pages, made a radient background in css). On second thought, just made background white. Not sure if background looks tacky here.
- bolded Minutes label

**Thoughts:** Today was a really fun day. I initially had a background on the minutes conveter, but I noticed that it clashed with the form on narrow pages. I removed the background which made the page look plain, but it was good enough for the time being. Then, I added pasted my code to codepen to check how it looks on phones. You can see the results in my tweet lol. The fixex footer was in the middle of the page, and everything else looked sloppy. That gave me a good laugh as I looked forward to figuring this thing out.

### Day 1: Wednesday February 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on a minutes to hours converter, and I was able to figure out the JavaScript code to make the conversion happen when click the Convert button.

**Thoughts** I've been coding regularly since December 2016, but this was my first independent project. When a user inputs a number, the output would be that number of minutes in hours. I created an else if statement for if userInput is 60 (the "hours" string would be singular in that case). I didn't look at any code for the statement so needless to say, I felt like a BOSS.
Also, I figured out how to show the answer in the console and as a pop up, but I couldn't figure out how to write it to the screen while controlling the placement.
