# 100 Days Of Code - The Mighty Log


### Day 6: Monday February 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Morning - Free Code Camp lessons. Evening - Got my first HTTP server up and running with node.js.

**Thoughts:** Node.js seems to be functioning properly. However, Express is still giving me issues. I don't think everything installed correctly (I saw some errors). Also, when trying to open package.json, I get the following: 
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

Being new to all of this, it's too early for me to even know what to look for in regards to what's going wrong. I'm going to keep pushing the next few days because I want to get this all set up and be able to shift more of my attention back to coding. Not a fun day of coding, but an important one.

### Day 5: Sunday February 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Spent more time learning how to use GitHub. Then, worked with Node.js and React for the first time at Free Code Camp. 

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how quickly you can go from feeling on top of the world to feeling like you know absolutely nothing. This happens often to me at our Free Code Camp meetups lol. I have a decent understanding of HTML and CSS, and I'm getting more comfortable with JavaScript, but I have never seen Node.js or React before. I felt like my brain was put in a blender, but I was happy to get exposed to both of these early in my learning. I've wanted to learn both, and I got a little preview of what they both are like.

### Day 4: Saturday February 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Learned my way around GitHub.

**Thoughts:** At this past Free Code Camp meetup, we spent a lot of time in GitHub. I felt like it was moving too fast, so I really wanted to get a grasp on how to use GitHub. It looked like I was looking at gibberish before, but now it makes a lot more sense.

### Day 3: Friday February 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Minutes to Hour Converer! Well, at least for now...
- added lang=""en-us"" to HTML
- added <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""> // trying to make mobile friendly
- removed parenthesis from around <h3> (it looked bad on mobile)
- added mobile friendly code from w3 schools in .body. Can't figure out how to move everything to the center now. Found it!!! Change margin to auto!!
- fixed footer on mobile by changing position from absolute to fixed :D

**Thoughts:** It felt really good completing my first little project (especially without using jQuery or Bootstrap). I intentially decided not to use those as I'm still early in learning JavaScript and want to have a better understanding of it first. Plus, it sounds like they are losing popularity anyway.

### Day 2: Thursday February 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Got the web version of my minutes to hours converter looking decent. However, the mobile view was UGLY! Specific steps:
- Added footer with copyright 
- changed background (removed clock img since it looked bad on narrow pages, made a radient background in css). On second thought, just made background white. Not sure if background looks tacky here.
- bolded Minutes label

**Thoughts:** Today was a really fun day. I initially had a background on the minutes conveter, but I noticed that it clashed with the form on narrow pages. I removed the background which made the page look plain, but it was good enough for the time being. Then, I added pasted my code to codepen to check how it looks on phones. You can see the results in my tweet lol. The fixex footer was in the middle of the page, and everything else looked sloppy. That gave me a good laugh as I looked forward to figuring this thing out.

### Day 1: Wednesday February 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on a minutes to hours converter, and I was able to figure out the JavaScript code to make the conversion happen when click the Convert button.

**Thoughts** I've been coding regularly since December 2016, but this was my first independent project. When a user inputs a number, the output would be that number of minutes in hours. I created an else if statement for if userInput is 60 (the "hours" string would be singular in that case). I didn't look at any code for the statement so needless to say, I felt like a BOSS.
Also, I figured out how to show the answer in the console and as a pop up, but I couldn't figure out how to write it to the screen while controlling the placement.
